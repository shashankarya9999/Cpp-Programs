### Is C++ a low level language?

The first thing I want to say is C Plus Plus is a low-level language. What does that mean? When I say low or high level, what I'm referring to is the level of abstraction of the underlying hardware. 

If you're writing in a high-level language, then you don't really have to worry about how the underlying machine is doing its work. You don't know how the transistors are switching. For example, you're not worrying about how the CPU deals with memory and things like that. There's all these low-level details about how the actual hardware operates. You don't need to consider those when you're operating in a higher-level language generally. 

High level is when, as I say, it's highly abstracted, it doesn't necessarily know how the underlying hardware functions and low-level is when you do have access to the underlying hardware and you have to take more account of how the hardware operates. C plus plus fits into that category. We deal with lower-level features of the operating system and the computer when we're working in C plus plus. 

The thing is there are certain advantages to both. If you're working in a high-level language, then you don't have to worry too much about how the underlying machineries going to execute your program. You can maybe just express those ideas that you need and get it to do what you need. 

Whereas if you're working in a low-level language, you do need to worry about that. But then the advantages, effectively you have more control because you got access to that machinery. You can make it operate exactly how you like. That's why C Plus Plus is a very useful language for doing things like critical systems and real-time systems like, for example, digital signal processing and avionics control, because you can design it in a way that's really aware of the hardware that it's running on.
