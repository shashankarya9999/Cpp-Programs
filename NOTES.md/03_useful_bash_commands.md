The Terminal in Visual Studio Code is a full Linux Bash console.

Bash is a really powerful command line shell with which you can interact with the virtual machine running there. 

Some basic commands that might be useful in Bash:

```ls -l``` 

list contents of current directory

```cd mydirector```

move into a directory called mydirectory

```pwd```

print out the present working directory

```g++ *.cpp -o myprogram```

build all the cpp files in the current director and output an executable binary called myprogram

```./myprogram```

run a program called myprogram in the current directory
