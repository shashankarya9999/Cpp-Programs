## My C++ Repository

This repository serves as a collection of all the programs I wrote in the process of learning C++. 

I took the C++ course( [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) ), taught by  Dr. Frank Mitropoulos, which coveres C++ language very extensively, from basic fundamentals to advanced concepts. Anyone who is also taking the aforementioned course may also check out the programs for reference. I have tried to maintain self-descriptive file names and comprehensible comments for easy understanding.

Additionally, I have also taken the Object-Oriented Programming with C++ specialization, offered by University of London through Coursera( [**link**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming-s12n) ). I am planning to complete it by the end of this summer.

I also intend to add more of my own insights and understandings of the language in this repository for future reference.
