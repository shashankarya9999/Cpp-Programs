### Copy Romeo and Juliet with line numbers

Provided the text to Romeo and Juliet in a file named romeojuliet.txt, I have to make a copy of the Romeo and Juliet file and save it to another file. <br>

This new copy should have line numbers at the beginning of each line in the play. Please format the numbers nicely so everything lines up.
