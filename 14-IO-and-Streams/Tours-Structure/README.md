Formatting output
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In this challenge, you are to display the provided data in a nicely formatted table.

There are 3 structures provided. Yes, these could also be classes with public data, but it's common to use structures when we simply want to model only data and not operations as we would with classes.

The structures work together to create a Tours structure that will contain information about Tours to South America. The Tours include Countries, Cities within those countries along with population and cost data for each city tour. I know, population? Huh? I just wanted a big number so that you can format it.

Create functions if you like, use constants, whatever you think makes sense!
